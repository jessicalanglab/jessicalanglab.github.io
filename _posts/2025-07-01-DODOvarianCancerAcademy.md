A DOD Early Career Investigator Award was funded for FY2025, starting on July 1st 2025. This award provides $725,000 over four years to develop high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma organoids, molecularly profile them, and test drug response. This award also provides mentorship of Dr. Lang by Dr. Manish Patankar, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, as well as membership to the Ovarian Cancer Academy, which will strengthen ties to the ovarian cancer research community. 

We look forward to making these models available to the research community when available and possible through current regulations.
