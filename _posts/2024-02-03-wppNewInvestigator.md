# Wisconsin Partnership Program New Investigator Award funded

We have been awarded the WPP New Investigator Award of $150,000 over two years. This project aims to transform ovarian cancer care by repurposing tumor cell-containing abdominal fluid (ascites) samples from patients to identify markers of treatment resistance. The ability to easily assess risk of resistance in patients would potentially eliminate the use of ineffective therapy and serve as a signal for determining when second-line therapies should be explored.

We would like to thank the Wisconsin Parnership Program for the opportunity and are excited to get started on this work!
