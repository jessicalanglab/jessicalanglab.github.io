Our DOD OCRP Pilot Award was selected for funding for FY2023, providing $300,000 over two years to study the functional requirement for super-enhancers in copy number amplified regions of high grade serous ovarian carcinoma genomes.

We look forward to continuing to apply functional genomics approaches to reveal the epigenetic contributions to ovarian cancer phenotypes.
