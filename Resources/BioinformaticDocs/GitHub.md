## GitHub
Our lab maintains a GitHub account ([jessicalanglab](https://github.com/jessicalanglab)) for project-related repositories. It is expected that you will contribute to GitHub respositories on which you contribute, and use our maintained repositories for reproducibility.

### Get started

#### Connect on GitHub
1. Create your own GitHub account if you do not have one already.
2. Request to be added to our lab's account as a user.
3. Familiarize yourself with the currently available repositories.
4. Ensure that Git and GitHub are accessible on your computer (locally or your server account)
