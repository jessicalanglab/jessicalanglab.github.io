These pages are designed to orient you to getting started with our computing infrastructure in the lab. It is expected that you have already reviewed onboarding instructions in our [lab manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dQNP4of_o7MRcO6lCtYrgRC46rELaqh7UycQNdqH0G0/edit?usp=sharing).

These documents are a starting point, and our practices may change over time. Please make suggestions to the group if you find some workflows or practices can be improved, or if you have found resources such as online workshops that are particularly helpful.
